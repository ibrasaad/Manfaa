## Introduction

Manfaa is a service exchange platform that enables small businesses and startups to trade professional services using time-based credits instead of cash.

Early-stage companies often need essential services such as legal support, accounting, marketing, design, or IT—but limited cash flow makes traditional payments difficult. At the same time, these businesses possess valuable skills and expertise that other companies need.

Manfaa creates a structured, trusted environment where businesses can exchange services fairly, track obligations, and build reputation—turning time and expertise into a usable currency.

## Problem Statement

Small businesses face three major challenges when accessing professional services:

- Limited cash flow, especially in early stages

- Lack of structured and trustworthy service bartering systems

- High upfront costs on freelancer and marketplace platforms

Informal service exchanges lack accountability, tracking, and trust, while paid platforms require cash.
Manfaah bridges this gap by providing a formal service exchange system backed by credits, contracts, and reputation.
